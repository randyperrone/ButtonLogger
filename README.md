# ButtonLogger
DESCRIPTION:

  Quick C# program that logs a timestamp and button pressed in a .csv file when a button is clicked.

HOW TO USE:

  By clicking the "start recording" button, a new file is created that is timestamped with the current date and time.  A line is also written in the file with the current time and the "start recording" tag.  If button 1 or button 2 are pressed, the time will be logged along with the button number that was pressed.
  
SETUP:

  This program is written in C# with Windows Presentation Foundation, so a Windows computer is needed or a program in Mac/Linux to open with.
